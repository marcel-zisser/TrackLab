        TrackLab makes use of the
        <a class="underline" href="https://docs.fastf1.dev/">FastF1</a>
        Python package for accessing Formula 1 data. I would like to sincerely thank theOehrly, the author and
        maintainer of
        FastF1, for the outstanding work in making high-quality Formula 1 data
        accessible to the community. The visualizations presented here would not be possible without their effort and
        dedication.
